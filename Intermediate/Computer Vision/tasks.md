# Computer Vision Tasks

## Overview
This folder contains Computer Vision tasks and starter notebooks for the Nile GDSC intermediate level.

## Getting Started
- Open `starter.ipynb` to begin
- Follow the instructions in the notebook
- Complete all required tasks

## Tasks

### Task 1: Image Classification with CNNs
Build a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images from a standard dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 or Fashion MNIST).

**Requirements:**
- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Design a CNN architecture with at least 3 convolutional layers
- Train the model and achieve at least 70% accuracy
- Visualize training/validation loss and accuracy curves
- Display sample predictions with confidence scores

### Task 2: Object Detection
Implement an object detection system using a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLO or Faster R-CNN).

**Requirements:**
- Load a pre-trained object detection model
- Process at least 5 different test images
- Draw bounding boxes around detected objects with labels
- Calculate and display confidence scores for each detection
- Handle multiple objects in a single image

### Task 3: Image Segmentation
Perform semantic segmentation on images using a pre-trained model or train a simple U-Net.

**Requirements:**
- Choose an appropriate dataset (e.g., Pascal VOC, Cityscapes subset)
- Implement or load a segmentation model
- Visualize the segmentation masks overlaid on original images
- Calculate IoU (Intersection over Union) scores
- Compare results on at least 3 different images
