# Deep Learning Tasks

## Overview
This folder contains Deep Learning tasks and starter notebooks for the Nile GDSC intermediate level.

## Getting Started
- Open `starter.ipynb` to begin
- Follow the instructions in the notebook
- Complete all required tasks

## Tasks

### Task 1: Neural Network from Scratch
Build a simple feedforward neural network from scratch using only NumPy.

**Requirements:**
- Implement forward propagation
- Implement backpropagation with gradient descent
- Train on a simple dataset (e.g., XOR problem or MNIST subset)
- Plot the loss curve over epochs
- Achieve convergence and demonstrate learning

### Task 2: Transfer Learning
Use transfer learning with a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet) for a custom classification task.

**Requirements:**
- Load a pre-trained model and freeze base layers
- Add custom classification layers
- Fine-tune on a new dataset (at least 3 classes)
- Compare performance with and without transfer learning
- Visualize feature maps from different layers

### Task 3: Regularization Techniques
Implement and compare different regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.

**Requirements:**
- Create a baseline model on a dataset of your choice
- Implement dropout regularization
- Implement L1/L2 weight regularization
- Apply batch normalization
- Compare validation performance across all approaches
- Visualize overfitting reduction
