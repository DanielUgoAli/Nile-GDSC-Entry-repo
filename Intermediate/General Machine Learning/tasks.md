# General Machine Learning Tasks

## Task 1: Feature Engineering and Model Comparison

Build and compare multiple ML models with feature engineering.

**Requirements:**
- Load a dataset (regression or classification)
- Perform feature engineering (scaling, encoding, creating new features)
- Train at least 3 different models
- Compare performance using appropriate metrics
- Perform cross-validation
- Visualize model comparison results

## Task 2: Ensemble Methods

Implement and compare ensemble learning techniques.

**Requirements:**
- Choose a dataset (classification or regression)
- Implement bagging (Random Forest or similar)
- Implement boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost)
- Implement stacking with multiple base models
- Compare all approaches with baseline single model
- Analyze feature importance

## Task 3: Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Optimization

Optimize a machine learning model through systematic hyperparameter tuning.

**Requirements:**
- Select a dataset and model type
- Implement Grid Search or Random Search
- Use cross-validation for evaluation
- Compare at least 5 different hyperparameter combinations
- Visualize the effect of different hyperparameters
- Report best model performance on test set
