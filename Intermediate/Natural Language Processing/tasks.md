# Natural Language Processing Tasks

## Overview
This folder contains Natural Language Processing tasks and starter notebooks for the Nile GDSC intermediate level.

## Getting Started
- Open `starter.ipynb` to begin
- Follow the instructions in the notebook
- Complete all required tasks

## Tasks

### Task 1: Text Classification with Word Embeddings
Build a text classifier using pre-trained word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText).

**Requirements:**
- Load a text classification dataset (e.g., IMDB reviews, news categories)
- Preprocess text (tokenization, padding, etc.)
- Use pre-trained embeddings or train your own
- Build an LSTM or GRU-based classifier
- Achieve at least 80% accuracy
- Display confusion matrix and classification report

### Task 2: Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Implement a Named Entity Recognition system to identify entities in text.

**Requirements:**
- Use a labeled NER dataset (e.g., CoNLL-2003)
- Build or use a pre-trained NER model
- Identify at least 3 entity types (Person, Location, Organization)
- Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score
- Demonstrate on custom example sentences

### Task 3: Text Generation with RNNs
Create a text generation model using Recurrent Neural Networks.

**Requirements:**
- Train on a text corpus (e.g., Shakespeare, song lyrics, or code)
- Implement character-level or word-level generation
- Use LSTM or GRU cells
- Generate coherent text samples with temperature sampling
- Compare outputs at different temperature values
- Show the model's ability to learn patterns from the training data
