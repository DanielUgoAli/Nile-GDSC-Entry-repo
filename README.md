# Nile-GDSC Application Questions Repository

This is the repository for the Nile GDSC application entry. Please make sure to read below before proceeding.

## Overview

This repository contains AI/ML tasks at two difficulty levels:

### Intermediate Level
Tasks designed for those with foundational knowledge in AI/ML. Each domain contains 3 tasks covering core concepts.

### Pro Level
Advanced tasks for experienced practitioners, featuring more complex challenges and real-world applications.

Both levels include tasks in three AI/ML domains:
- **Computer Vision** - Image processing, object detection, and segmentation
- **Deep Learning** - Neural networks, transfer learning, and regularization
- **Natural Language Processing** - Text classification, NER, and text generation

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your level**: Navigate to either `Intermediate/` or `Pro/` folder
2. **Select a domain**: Choose from Computer Vision, Deep Learning, or NLP
3. **Read the instructions**: Review the `README.md` and `tasks.md` in your chosen folder
4. **Complete the tasks**: Open `starter.ipynb` and complete **ANY ONE task** (or 2 if you want to challenge yourself)
